I contributed the chapter "Hunting for Command and Control" to Sqrrl's book, [Huntpedia: Your Threat Hunting Knowledge Compendium](https://www.threathunting.net/files/huntpedia.pdf). The chapter was originally a blog post on the Sqrrl website and was later reused in the book. I don't remember when the book was released, but I think it was sometime in 2018 (after I left the company). I may also have a few physical copies if anyone wants one?!

If you don't know what Sqrrl was or what happened to it, then go [here](https://aws.amazon.com/detective/).
