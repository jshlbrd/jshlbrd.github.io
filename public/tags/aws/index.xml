      <description>The Trick Aggregate multiple records into a single aggregated record. That’s it.&#xA;Why It Works The AWS Kinesis Data Streams service bills based on two criteria: the number of shards running per hour (“shard hours”) and the amount of bytes per record put into each stream. Each shard has a maximum capacity (either 1,000 records written per second or 1 MB written per second) and while there are potential savings in managing shard hours, the greater cost savings is in managing record sizes.</description>
